# pony-TPS-game
This is my untitled Unity3D game project. It was intended for learning but ended up as larger project.
Models, animations, music and scripting was made by me. Sounds were found on the Internet. 
The development started in Feb 2017 and ended in Jun 2018 due to lack of time and small interest of community.

## Main features
- Third Person Shooter
- Multiplayer
- Customizable characters
- Variety of weapons (guns, rocket launchers, grenades and even swords)
- 3 playable classes (normal pony, unicorn and pegasus)
- 1 playable map
