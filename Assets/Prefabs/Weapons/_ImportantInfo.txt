VERY IMPORTANT MESSAGE!

If gun controlling scripts are not working properly check if there is a hole in numeration!

There shouldn't be any hole in numeration AND each gun have to have individual ID.

PRO TIP:
More important weapons should have smaller numbers.
After chanigng weapons alignment affects "CLASS LOADOUT" in PassDataScript so you should check innitial data for it!
